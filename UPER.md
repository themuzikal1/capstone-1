<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I need to create an e-commerce website using React.
I am new to JS and React.
What type of products do I want to sell?
How do I create a search functionality?
How to I render each item on the page?
How do I incorporate Stripe? How do I test?
Many resources are outdated

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*Will sell professional keyboards.
Look at other websites/apps for music instruments
Do a wireframe for the layout.  Used Balsamiq
Do research on react components.
Choose a styling library. 
Take a look a previous apps that I have built.  The Counter App and the To-do and see how to display items.
Look at the React and Bootstrap documentation

    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*Picked out the top keyboards, found pictures, data
Create the UI 
Create an API for the data
Build shopping cart
Build search functionality
Be sure everything is responsive
Incorporate Stripe if I have time.

    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*Refactorâ€”there is a better way to display the cards.
I was repeating myself-I had data in my API but I was also repeating it in my Cards component. 
Pass the information from the API as an array that will iterate and display all of the items in inventory
Is my UI responsive? Yes
Does my UI look presentable? Yes
Search functionality is not working and was a challenge.  Rather than include a feature that is buggy, I left it off
The code can definitely be refactored
